I am an **AI Engineer** working across **computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal AI**. My expertise spans from developing label-free algorithms like the **Clustered Feature Weighting (CFW) method**—which addressed long-tailed data distributions and improved cross-modality adaptation in large driver distraction detection datasets-to building **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and multi-agent chatbots**. I hold an M.Sc. in *Mechatronics* with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from *Universität Siegen*, where my thesis on **self-supervised driver distraction detection** was conducted in collaboration with [Fraunhofer IOSB](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/) and [Compuet Vision Group Uni-Siegen](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en) under the guidance of [Prof. Michael Möller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/), [Dr. Jovita Lukasik](https://jovitalukasik.github.io/) and [M.Sc. David Lerch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BDOfyn8AAAAJ).

At [Fraunhofer IOSB](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/), I contributed to **Human–AI Interaction projects** including [KARLI](https://karli-projekt.de/) and [SALSA](https://projekt-salsa.de/en/), working with [Dr.-Ing. Michael Voit](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/press/press-releases/2024/human-ai-interaction-new-department-focus.html), [Dr.-Ing. Frederik Diederichs](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte-produkte/integrated-autonomous-driving-lab.html), and [M.Sc. David Lerch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BDOfyn8AAAAJ). There, I integrated **vision–language models and multimodal pipelines** for driver attention analysis and sleep stage recognition. Earlier, in the [Visual Computing Group](https://www.vc.informatik.uni-siegen.de/) led by [Prof. Margret Keuper](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/focus-groups/computer-vision-machine-learning-prof-dr-ing-margret-keuper/), I worked on **Out-Of-Distribution Robustness, GANs, Latent Diffusion Models, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)**, building strong foundations in computer vision and generative artificial intelligence.
